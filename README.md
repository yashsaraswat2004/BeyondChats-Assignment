## ✨ Overview

Welcome to my submission for the Beyond Chats assignment!  
This project is a pixel-perfect, highly responsive, and interactive clone of the demo UI, built with **React + TypeScript** and **Material UI**.  
It demonstrates not just technical skill, but also a focus on user experience, accessibility, and modern design trends.

- **TypeScript:** Used for type safety and maintainability. If a JavaScript-only version is required, I can provide one.

## 💪 Personal Note

During this assignment, I faced a major setback: I lost my SSD and all my recent work, including 60% of this project, due to not having a backup.  
Despite this, I rebuilt everything from scratch in just 2 days.  
While this version reflects my best effort under the circumstances, I am confident I could deliver even more with more time or another opportunity.

Thank you for considering my application!
